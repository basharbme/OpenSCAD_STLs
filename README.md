# OpenSCAD_STLs

A collection of parts I designed and printed for the Smart Surgical Tools and 3d Bioprinter projects.

I got the basic idea for the openPump parts from online STL files, but upon printing noticed several
areas that could be improved upon for our particular project. So, I coded up my own models and that
is what is presented here.

The pedicle parts are to be used with an instrument called a pedicle probe that is used in spinal surgery.
These parts are used to affix the probe to a load/torque, imu, and distance sensors.
